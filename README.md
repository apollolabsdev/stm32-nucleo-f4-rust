# Rust Project Examples and Templates for STM32 Nucleo-F401RE

This repository contains example projects that can also be used as templates written in the Rust programming language targeting the STM32 Nucleo-F401RE development board from ST Microelectronics.

Each of these these projects has an accompanying blog post explaining the code in more detail [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/). The various projects can be also used as a starting point for programming your Nucleo board.

These templates were generated in VSCode. To set up a template project specific to the STM32 Nucleo-F401RE, you can follow [this](https://apollolabs.notion.site/STM32F4xx-VSCode-Project-Setup-3cdea2ce79f34a08a1a7e3f987e992a7) tutorial.

The code in this repository should also be compatible with a various number of STM32 devices that are supported by the STM32F4xx HAL. You can refer to the STM32F4xx HAL repository for the full list of devices that are supported.
