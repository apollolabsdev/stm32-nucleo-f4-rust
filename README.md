# Rust Project Examples and Templates for STM32Nucleo-F4

This repository contains example projects that can also be used as templates written in the Rust programming language targeting the STM32Nucleo-F4 development board from ST.

Each of these these projects has an accompanying blog post explaining the code in more detail [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/). The various projects can be also used as a starting point for programming your Nucleo board.

These templates were generated in VSCode. If you need to setup the whole tool-chain, you can follow this tutorial.

The code in this repository should also be compatible with a various number of STM32 devices that are supported by the STM32F4xx HAL. You can refer to the STM32F4xx HAL repositopry for the full list of devices that are supported.
